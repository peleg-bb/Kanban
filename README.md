A Kanban application for managing team tasks.
This project was done in introduction to Software Engineering course, a 1st year course in our Software Engineering degree.
The main goal of the project was to build a multi layered application and integrate the different areas. 
The app has a business layer which contains all the logic, an SQLite database, a service layer and an MVVM front end. 
Note that the backend supports a lot of features which haven't been implemented in the front end due to the course requirements and time constraints.
